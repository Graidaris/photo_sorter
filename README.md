# Photo sorter
This program can sort your photo by places and date. To determine name of the location I use API of [opencagedata.com](https://opencagedata.com/)

# Getting started

1. Install python 3.7.*
2. Install all dependency of the program
   - ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

3. Run the program
   - ```python3 main.py```
   
4. For using this program (namely using locations sort), you need to take your own API-key from [opencagedata.com](https://opencagedata.com/)
